# AIED20

This folder contains the scripts used to obtained the results presented in the paper presented at AIED20.

In order not to re-estimate the ground truth latent traits at each run, they were computed only once and later loaded 
with pickle while training each model.

---

The scripts are grouped according to the sections of the paper:

* 5.1 experiments on latent traits estimation
* 5.2 experiments on students' performance prediction (they have to be run in the correct order)
* 5.3 ablation study
